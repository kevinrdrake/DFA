# DFA
Weakly divisible by 7 DFA. Means if you remove a number from another number, ex 134 to 14 by removing the 3, then it is weakly divisible. Also if it is naturally divisible by 7, it is accepted. This will count the number of accepted numbers when given a number of digits. Ex an inept of 3 would be a 3 digit number.
